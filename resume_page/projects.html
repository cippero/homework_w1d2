    <p>The Jellyfish Archer was created as part of my thesis project on the world of Diluvion. As the game takes place in a larger environment where submarines are the norm and there's no 3D humans in the game, I focused mainly on the people that would inhabit this world.</p>

    <p>The Kraken was created as a boss encounter for Diluvion. I first made a basemesh in Maya to establish proportions, then sculpted in ZBrush and baked in Xnormal. I created the animatable game-res sections in 3D coat and anything that isn't meant to be animated using decimation master in ZBrush. Finally, I used Substance Painter and Photoshop to texture and Marmoset to render.</p>
